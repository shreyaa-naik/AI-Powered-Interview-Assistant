# AI-Powered Interview Assistant (Crisp Internship Assignment)

This project is a full-featured, AI-powered interview simulator built using **React** and **Vite**. It provides a synchronized two-tab interface for the **Interviewee** (chat) and the **Interviewer** (dashboard), complete with local data persistence and dynamic question generation.

## ‚ú® Features

### Interviewee (Chat)
* **Resume Upload & Parsing:** Supports **PDF** (required) and **DOCX** (optional) for initial profile setup.
* **Profile Extraction:** Automatically extracts **Name, Email, and Phone**. Chatbot prompts the candidate to fill any missing fields before the interview starts.
* **Timed Interview Flow:**
    * **Dynamic Questions:** AI generates **random, unique questions** for a **Full Stack (React/Node)** role.
    * **6 Questions Total:** 2 Easy, 2 Medium, 2 Hard.
    * **Question Timers:** Easy (20s), Medium (60s), Hard (120s).
    * **Auto-Submit:** Answers are submitted automatically when the timer runs out.
    * **Final Score & Summary:** AI calculates a final score and generates a short candidate summary upon completion.
* **Persistence:** Uses `redux-persist` to save all progress locally. Sessions are fully restored on refresh/reopen, displaying a **"Welcome Back" modal** for unfinished sessions.

### Interviewer (Dashboard)
* **Candidate List:** Shows all candidates, primarily sorted by **Final AI Score**.
* **Detailed View:** Clicking a candidate shows their full **chat history** (Q&A), profile, and AI scores for each question.
* **Search & Sort:** Functionality to search candidates by name/email and sort by score/date.
* **Data Management:**
    * **Export Candidate Data:** Ability to **export** a candidate's full profile and assessment data as a **CSV file**.
    * **Clear Data:** Option to **clear/reset all local candidate data**.
